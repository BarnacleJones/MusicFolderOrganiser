# MusicFolderOrganiser

This is a script cooked up on a saturday arvo for organising my music folder.

It was made with the help of chatGPT, but I have ironed out most of the kinks.

Error log will give you indication if anything went wrong and what it was.

To get it going:

  install python and pip

  then run sudo pip install mutagen pydub

  then run sudo python3 musicOrganiser.py

NOTE for future - copy music files to a new folder before running this, once they're moved, there is no going back!
